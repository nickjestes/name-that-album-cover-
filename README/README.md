My project is called "Video Game Trivia!". 
The goal of the program was to write 10 quiz questions that relate to video game trivia, with a timer, adding to a total score, asking your name
then being able to display a high score with a choice to either exit or play again. 

I had a lot of help from online resources for this one, but was able to write/personalize the code individually using the notes and descriptions
provided.
